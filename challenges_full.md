## CHALLENGE 1: THE SEVEN NATIONS

**When:** Phase 1, House A, Rotation 1
**Type:** Individual / Speed
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Players:** All 17 in House A

### MATERIALS
- Whiteboard or large paper
- Marker
- Timer (phone)

### SETUP
Host stands at the front with the board. All players stand in a group facing the host.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Welcome to the castle. Before we trust anyone here, we need to know who among you has a brain worth keeping alive."
>
> "There are SEVEN countries in Central America. You will go around the room one at a time. When I point to you, you have FIVE SECONDS to name a Central American country that has NOT already been named. If you repeat a country, name a wrong country, or run out of time -- you are OUT."
>
> "We will continue in a circle until only ONE person remains. That person earns a SHIELD -- they cannot be murdered tonight."

### HOST NOTES
- The seven countries: Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama.
- Write each correct answer on the board so everyone can see what has been said.
- Once all 7 are named, erase the board and start over with a fresh slate. Players must remember what they said before. This is where it gets interesting.
- If there is a tie (multiple people survive a full loop), do a sudden-death speed round: host points at two finalists, first to shout a correct country wins.
- Keep energy HIGH. Count down "5... 4... 3..." loudly.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder:** The winner cannot be killed by traitors tonight. Announce this publicly.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Traitors receive NO special sabotage instruction for this challenge. This is an early, clean challenge to establish trust. However, traitors should note:
- If a traitor WINS this challenge, they earn the shield themselves, which is wasted protection (since traitors are never murdered). This is suspicious if anyone is paying attention later.
- Traitors may want to deliberately lose mid-round to avoid winning the shield, which could draw suspicion.
- If a faithful player wins, traitors simply cannot kill that player tonight and must choose someone else.

**Strategic note for host:** If a traitor wins, do NOT reveal this is "wasted." Let players figure it out organically.

---
---

## CHALLENGE 2: BARK OR BULL?

**When:** Phase 1, House B, Rotation 1
**Type:** Individual / Trivia
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Players:** All 17 in House B

### MATERIALS
- Pre-printed or phone-displayed list of 10 dog "facts" (below)
- Players need nothing (they use stand/crouch)

### SETUP
All players stand. Host reads statements one at a time.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "In honor of the birthday girl's dog turning FIVE today, we are playing BARK OR BULL."
>
> "I will read 10 statements about dogs. Some are real facts. Some are complete nonsense. For each statement, you must decide: is it BARK (true) or BULL (false)?"
>
> "If you think it is TRUE, stay STANDING. If you think it is FALSE, CROUCH DOWN. You have 5 seconds to decide after I read each one."
>
> "If you get it WRONG, you are eliminated from this challenge. Last person standing wins a SHIELD."

### THE 10 STATEMENTS

| # | Statement | Answer | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | A dog's nose print is unique, like a human fingerprint. | BARK (True) | Easy warm-up |
| 2 | The rapper who performed "Who Let the Dogs Out" was DMX. | BULL (False) | It was Baha Men |
| 3 | Dogs can see in complete darkness. | BULL (False) | They see better in low light but not total darkness |
| 4 | A Greyhound can beat a Cheetah in a long-distance race. | BARK (True) | Cheetahs tire after 30 seconds; Greyhounds sustain 35mph for miles |
| 5 | The lyric "Bitch, I'm a dog -- ROOF" comes from the Migos song "Versace." | BARK (True) | Offset's verse |
| 6 | Dalmatians are born completely white. | BARK (True) | Spots develop after 2-3 weeks |
| 7 | The world's oldest dog lived to be 31 years old. | BARK (True) | Bobi, a Portuguese dog, verified at 31 |
| 8 | Dogs sweat through their tongues. | BULL (False) | They pant to cool down but sweat through their paw pads |
| 9 | In the original Monopoly, the dog piece was the first token ever added to the game. | BULL (False) | The original tokens were iron, car, thimble, etc. Dog was added later |
| 10 | A group of Pugs is called a "grumble." | BARK (True) | This is real and delightful |

**HOST NOTE:** Review these before game night and adjust any that feel too ambiguous. The key is confidence in delivery. If a statement is debatable, own your ruling. You are the castle authority.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder:** Last person standing cannot be murdered tonight.
- **Tiebreaker:** If multiple players survive all 10 rounds, ask a bonus question: "How many teeth does an adult dog have?" (Answer: 42). Closest guess wins.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

No direct sabotage mechanic. This is a knowledge challenge. However:
- Traitors should be coached (in their private briefing) that winning shields as a traitor is a WASTE and subtly suspicious. They should try to lose mid-challenge (around round 5-6) to appear normal.
- If a traitor wins, the host privately notes it but says nothing. Observant faithful may notice later that the "shielded" person was never in danger anyway.

## CHALLENGE 3: THE GAUNTLET OF HANDS

**When:** Phase 1, House A, Rotation 2
**Type:** Physical / Elimination
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes
**Players:** All remaining House A players (~15)

### MATERIALS
- One coin (quarter or similar)
- A table or flat surface where players can sit around it

### SETUP
All players sit in a circle or around a table. One player is designated the "Guesser" (the person who received the most banishment votes last round but survived -- if no one fits, host picks the youngest player).

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle demands a sacrifice of trust. One among you will prove their perception."
>
> "Everyone except the Guesser: put your hands flat on the table, palms down. Close your eyes."
>
> "I will walk behind you and place a coin in ONE person's hand. That person will close their fist. Everyone else keeps hands flat."
>
> "Guesser: you have 60 SECONDS and THREE GUESSES to find the coin. If you find it, you earn a Shield. If you fail, the person holding the coin earns the Shield."
>
> "EVERYONE: your job is to look equally guilty. Clench your fists, shift your eyes, act nervous -- or stay perfectly still. Deceive the Guesser."

### HOST NOTES
- Walk behind ALL players, touching each person's hands briefly, even the ones who do not get the coin. This prevents the guesser from watching where you stop.
- Players should be encouraged to trash-talk, misdirect, and psychologically mess with the guesser. This is social deduction practice.
- If the Guesser finds the coin on guess 1, the round is over instantly -- big dramatic moment.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder:** The winner (either the Guesser if they find it, or the Coin-Holder if they don't) cannot be murdered tonight.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "If the coin is placed in YOUR hand, you should try to be FOUND. Fidget subtly. Make slightly-too-obvious eye contact. The goal is to NOT win the shield -- let it go to the Guesser instead. You do not need the shield, and winning it is a waste."

> "If the Guesser is a fellow Traitor, the coin-holding Traitor should make it EASY for them to guess correctly, so the Traitor-Guesser wins a shield they don't need either, BUT it looks like a legitimate win and builds their social capital."

This is a soft sabotage -- traitors are manipulating who gets the shield rather than directly cheating.

## CHALLENGE 4: STOLEN PORTRAITS

**When:** Phase 1, House B, Rotation 2
**Type:** Team / Memory
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Players:** All remaining House B players (~15), split into 3 teams of 5

### MATERIALS
- 3 trays or plates, each with 15-20 small household objects (keys, pens, coins, candy, bottle caps, rubber bands, etc.)
- 3 sheets of paper and pens (one per team)
- A towel or cloth to cover each tray

### SETUP
Prepare three identical (or near-identical) trays of 15-20 small objects before the game. Place each tray on a separate table/area. Cover them with towels. Divide players into 3 teams of ~5.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Paintings have been stolen from the castle gallery. Your team must prove you have the sharpest memory to recover them."
>
> "Each team will stand around a tray. When I say GO, you will have 30 SECONDS to study the objects on your tray. Then I will cover the tray."
>
> "I will then REMOVE 3 objects from under the cover. Your team has 60 SECONDS to write down which 3 objects are missing."
>
> "The team that correctly identifies the most missing objects wins. If there is a tie, the team that wrote their answers FIRST wins."

### HOST NOTES
- Have a helper or pre-plan which 3 objects to remove from each tray.
- Remove objects while the tray is covered (reach under the towel or step away briefly).
- This challenge rewards team communication and memory. It is fast-paced and surprisingly intense.
- Encourage teams to strategize: "Should each person memorize one section of the tray?"

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder:** The winning team collectively earns a shield. Traitors cannot murder any member of the winning team tonight.
- This is a powerful reward, so it is balanced by the fact that a traitor could be on the winning team (wasting part of the shield's value).

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "During the 30-second study period, subtly DISTRACT your teammates. Point out obvious objects loudly ('Look, a RED pen!') to draw attention away from less obvious objects. During the 60-second answer period, confidently suggest WRONG answers. Say things like 'I definitely saw a paperclip, and I don't see it now' even if the paperclip is still there."

> "Your goal is to make your team lose WITHOUT being obviously wrong. Suggest answers with confidence. If challenged, back down gracefully -- 'Oh wait, maybe you're right, I'm thinking of the other tray.'"

This is strong sabotage because memory challenges rely on team trust. A confident wrong voice can tank the whole effort.

---

## CHALLENGE 5: THE SILENT LINE (DIRECT DEATH CHALLENGE)

**When:** Phase 1, House A, Rotation 3
**Type:** Individual / Social -- INSTANT ELIMINATION
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Players:** All remaining House A players (~13)

### MATERIALS
- None

### SETUP
Clear a long space. All players stand in a cluster at one end.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle is losing patience. This is a DIRECT DEATH CHALLENGE. There is no debate. There is no vote. The result is FINAL."
>
> "You must arrange yourselves in a single-file line from OLDEST to YOUNGEST. Birthday month and day count. Year of birth is what matters most."
>
> "Here is the catch: you may NOT SPEAK. No whispering. No mouthing words. No holding up fingers for numbers. You may only use GESTURES -- pointing, nodding, physically moving people."
>
> "You have 90 SECONDS."
>
> "When time is up, I will check. The TWO people who are the MOST out of position are INSTANTLY BANISHED from the game."

### HOST NOTES
- This replaces the normal debate + vote for this rotation. It IS the banishment.
- "Most out of position" means the two people whose actual rank is farthest from where they are standing. Example: if the 2nd-oldest person is standing in the 12th position, they are 10 spots off.
- You must know (or quickly determine) all players' birthdays. Have this on a cheat sheet or ask players to verify after.
- This is BRUTAL and dramatic. Lean into it. Count down the final 10 seconds loudly.
- Night murder still happens after this. So this rotation removes up to 3 people (2 death challenge + 1 murder).

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **No individual winner.** Survival IS the reward. The challenge exists to accelerate the game toward merge.
- There is no shield. The terror is the point.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "You know each other. During the silent line, subtly MISPLACE a faithful player. If you are next to a faithful player, gently guide them to a wrong position using gestures. Point them further down the line than they should be. Act confused about your own age to create chaos."

> "Do NOT misplace yourself -- you do not want to be the one eliminated. Focus on making one faithful player end up far from their correct spot."

> "If two traitors are near each other, work together silently to shift a faithful player between you into the wrong zone."

This is dangerous sabotage because the penalty is instant banishment with no defense. A traitor who successfully shifts a faithful player 5+ spots could get them killed.

## CHALLENGE 6: SPY GLASS (GEOGUESSER)

**When:** Phase 1, House B, Rotation 3
**Type:** Team / Geoguesser
**Duration:** 5-6 minutes
**Players:** All remaining House B players (~13), split into 2 teams

### MATERIALS
- A laptop or TV screen visible to all players
- GeoGuessr website (free mode) or pre-selected Google Street View screenshots (5 locations)
- Paper and pens for each team

### SETUP
Split remaining House B players into two teams. Display GeoGuessr (or pre-saved Street View images) on a shared screen. If using the website, use "Battle Royale" mode or simply take turns guessing the same locations.

**PRE-GAME PREP:** If you do not have a GeoGuessr account, screenshot 5 Google Street View locations from around the world before game night. Choose a mix of easy (Eiffel Tower visible), medium (a road sign in a foreign language), and hard (a dirt road with vegetation clues only).

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle has a magical Spy Glass that can see anywhere in the world. But the glass is cracked -- you can only see fragments."
>
> "I will show you 5 locations. For each location, both teams have 30 SECONDS to discuss and write down the COUNTRY you think it is."
>
> "Correct country = 1 point. BEST OF 5. The winning team earns TWO SHIELDS -- each member of the winning team is safe from murder tonight."

### HOST NOTES
- Best of 5 means ties are impossible (unless both teams tie at 2-2 going into round 5, in which case round 5 is sudden death).
- If using the GeoGuessr website live, use the free "play" mode and drop a pin for each team. Closer pin wins the round.
- If using screenshots, just accept country-level guesses.
- Suggested locations mix: 1 easy (a famous landmark is barely visible), 2 medium (road signs in a non-English language, distinctive architecture), 2 hard (rural roads, vegetation, sun angle).

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **TWO Shields:** Every member of the winning team is shielded from murder tonight. This is a massive reward.
- In a group of ~13, this protects roughly half the remaining players. The traitors' murder options are severely limited.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "During the 30-second team discussion, confidently push for a WRONG country if you think your team is close to the right answer. Say things like 'No, look at the road markings -- that is definitely [wrong country].' Use specific-sounding reasoning to override correct instincts."

> "If your team seems hopeless on a round anyway, agree with the group -- only sabotage when it matters. You need to lose this challenge so that MORE faithful are unshielded tonight."

> "If both traitors on a team sabotage too hard, it may look suspicious. Coordinate: one of you plays the confident-wrong-guesser, the other stays quiet and agrees."

This is high-impact sabotage. The shield reward is enormous, so traitors have strong motivation to tank it.

## CHALLENGE 7: THE CHALICE TOAST

**When:** Merge Ceremony (22 players combine)
**Type:** Social / Ritual
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes of mingling
**Players:** All 22 merged players

### MATERIALS
- Enough cups/chalices for all players (plastic wine glasses, solo cups, anything)
- A drink for toasting (juice, water, wine, whatever fits the party)

### SETUP
As soon as the merge is announced, the host distributes chalices to all 22 players.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Two houses become one. To mark this union, we raise a glass."
>
> "Take a chalice. For the next 3 minutes, MINGLE. Toast to your fellow players. Celebrate surviving this far."
>
> "You may toast anyone. You may toast in groups. You may toast alone. This is a moment of fellowship."
>
> "When the bell rings, the toast is over. Set down your chalices. The game continues."

### HOST NOTES
- This is NOT a competitive challenge. It is the Chalice Mark ceremony from the Power Mechanics document.
- Play atmospheric music during the mingling.
- The host MUST watch carefully for the traitor activation (see below).
- After the toast, transition immediately into the Merge Round 1 debate.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- None. This is a ritual, not a scored challenge.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE (THE CHALICE MARK)

This is a CRITICAL mechanic. During the private traitor briefing at merge, tell ALL traitors:

> "ONE of you -- and only one -- may activate the Chalice Mark during the toast. To do this:"
>
> 1. "Choose a faithful player."
> 2. "Interlock your arm with theirs (the classic wedding-toast arm-link)."
> 3. "Say the word 'Cheers' while looking them in the eye."
> 4. "Sip together."
>
> "The HOST must witness this happen. Make eye contact with the host or position yourself so the host can see."
>
> "That player is now MARKED. Tonight, instead of the normal murder vote, the Marked player dies automatically. No traitor vote needed."
>
> "Rules: Only ONE traitor may do this. Only usable once, ever. If no traitor activates it, a normal murder occurs tonight instead."

**HOST: Watch the room like a hawk. Many people will interlock arms and toast -- that is the genius of this mechanic. It hides in plain sight. You need to identify which toast is the REAL activation. The traitor will make eye contact with you.**

**If multiple traitors accidentally activate it, only the FIRST one counts.**

## CHALLENGE 8: THE DAGGER DUEL (ROCK PAPER SCISSORS TOURNAMENT)

**When:** Merge, Round 1 Challenge
**Type:** Competitive / Bracket Tournament
**Duration:** 5-8 minutes
**Players:** All 22 merged players

### MATERIALS
- None (just hands)
- A bracket drawn on a whiteboard or large paper (optional but dramatic)

### SETUP
Draw a single-elimination bracket for 22 players (or just run it freestyle). Pair players up. If odd numbers, one player gets a first-round bye (host picks randomly or gives it to the most recent banishment survivor).

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "In the castle armory, there is a weapon of great power: THE DAGGER. It allows its wielder to cast TWO votes at a single banishment."
>
> "To claim it, you must win the Dagger Duel."
>
> "This is a single-elimination ROCK PAPER SCISSORS tournament. Best of 3 per match. Winners advance. Losers sit down."
>
> "Stand and face your opponent. On my count: ROCK... PAPER... SCISSORS... SHOOT."
>
> "The last player standing claims THE DAGGER."

### HOST NOTES
- Run matches simultaneously to save time. Pair everyone up, let all first-round matches happen at once, then pair winners, repeat.
- With 22 players, you need ~5 elimination rounds. At best-of-3 per match, each round takes about 30 seconds. Total time: under 5 minutes.
- Draw the bracket on a board if you want drama. Cross out losers. Let the crowd cheer.
- The finals should be done CENTER STAGE with everyone watching. Best of 5 for the final match (for drama).

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **THE DAGGER:** The winner may cast TWO votes at a single banishment round. Both votes must target the same player. They must declare "I use the Dagger" before votes are revealed. Expires after 2 rounds. Cannot be used at Final 6.
- Announce this publicly. Everyone should know who holds the Dagger.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

There is no direct sabotage in Rock Paper Scissors (it is pure chance/psychology). However:

> "Traitors: if you make it to the final rounds, CONSIDER LOSING on purpose. The Dagger is powerful but publicly visible. Holding it draws attention. If a faithful player wins the Dagger, they might waste it on another faithful player during a chaotic debate."

> "If a traitor DOES win the Dagger, use it strategically: double-vote against a faithful player who is gaining social power and threatening to expose traitors. But be aware that using the Dagger aggressively will make you a target."

**HOST NOTE:** If a traitor wins, this is actually fine. The Dagger is a double-edged sword (pun intended). It draws as much suspicion as it provides power.

---
---

## CHALLENGE 9: THE POISONED FEAST

**When:** Merge, Round 2
**Type:** Team / Deduction
**Duration:** 5-6 minutes
**Players:** All remaining merged players (~19)

### MATERIALS
- 19 small cups (shot glasses, paper cups, anything small)
- Water for 16 cups
- Water + a few drops of food coloring (or lemon juice, hot sauce, vinegar -- anything taste-able) for 3 cups
- A tray to hold all cups

### SETUP
Prepare 19 cups. 16 contain plain water. 3 contain the "poison" (tinted water, lemon water, or similar -- nothing harmful). Arrange them randomly on a tray. Number each cup on the bottom with a marker (for host tracking).

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle chef has prepared a feast. But someone has POISONED three of the goblets."
>
> "Each of you will choose a cup and drink. If your cup is POISONED, you will know immediately (it tastes different)."
>
> "If you are poisoned, you must DECIDE: reveal yourself honestly, or LIE and say you are fine."
>
> "After everyone drinks, we go around the room. Each person declares: 'I am nourished' (safe) or 'I am poisoned.' You may LIE about your status."
>
> "The group must then reach consensus: WHO among you is actually poisoned? You have 2 MINUTES to discuss."
>
> "For each poisoned player the group correctly identifies, the group earns 1 point (max 3). If the group scores 2 or more, EVERYONE earns a shield tonight."

### HOST NOTES
- The "poison" should be harmless but distinctly taste-able. Lemon juice in water works well. Soy sauce (very small amount) is dramatic. Hot sauce is hilarious but check for allergies first.
- The deduction element: people who are poisoned may lie about it, and people who are safe may claim to be poisoned to create chaos.
- This naturally creates a social deduction mini-game WITHIN the larger game.
- If players have dietary restrictions, use something universally safe or let them opt out (they auto-declare "nourished").

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Group Shield:** If the group correctly identifies 2+ of the 3 poisoned players, ALL remaining players are shielded tonight (no murder can occur).
- If the group fails (identifies 0-1 correctly), no shields. Normal murder proceeds.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "If YOU drink a poisoned cup, LIE. Say 'I am nourished.' This wastes one of the group's identifications."

> "If you drink a safe cup, you have two options:"
> 1. "Claim to be poisoned (creates confusion, wastes the group's guesses on you instead of the real targets)."
> 2. "Stay honest and use the discussion period to cast suspicion on a faithful player: 'Did you see their face when they drank? They are definitely lying about being safe.'"

> "Your goal is to prevent the group from hitting 2 correct identifications. If the group fails, there is no shield, and you can murder freely tonight."

This is ELITE-level sabotage. The challenge is designed to test honesty in a game literally about deception. Traitors have enormous leverage here.

## CHALLENGE 10: THE CRYPT COUNTDOWN

**When:** Merge, Round 3
**Type:** Collaborative / Timed
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Players:** All remaining merged players (~17)

### MATERIALS
- A phone timer or a projected countdown timer with sound effects (search "dramatic countdown timer" on YouTube)
- 10 trivia questions of escalating difficulty (prepared in advance, listed below)

### SETUP
All players stand in a group. Host faces them with the questions. Set a visible countdown timer for 3 MINUTES.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle crypt is flooding. The doors will seal in 3 MINUTES."
>
> "To escape, you must answer 10 trivia questions. You work TOGETHER -- anyone may shout an answer. But you must answer them IN ORDER. You cannot skip ahead."
>
> "If you answer all 10 before time runs out, the group SURVIVES and earns a collective shield."
>
> "If time runs out... no shield. The traitors feast tonight."

### THE 10 QUESTIONS (Escalating Difficulty)

1. What planet is closest to the Sun? **(Mercury)**
2. How many sides does a hexagon have? **(6)**
3. What year did the Titanic sink? **(1912)**
4. What is the capital of Australia? **(Canberra)** -- NOT Sydney
5. In what sport would you perform a "double axel"? **(Figure skating)**
6. What element has the chemical symbol "Au"? **(Gold)**
7. Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? **(Michelangelo)**
8. What is the smallest country in the world by area? **(Vatican City)**
9. In Greek mythology, who flew too close to the sun? **(Icarus)**
10. What is the only mammal capable of true flight? **(Bat)**

**HOST: Replace any questions that are too easy or too hard for your specific group. You know your friends.**

### HOST NOTES
- Start the timer dramatically. Use a YouTube countdown with tense music if possible.
- If the group crushes it in under 2 minutes, congratulate them but note privately who answered the most.
- Move fast between questions. The time pressure is the whole point.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Group Shield (Conditional):** If all 10 questions are answered before time runs out, NO MURDER occurs tonight.
- If they fail, the traitors may kill as normal.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "DO NOT answer questions correctly, even if you know the answer. Stay quiet and let faithful players carry the load."

> "If the group is stuck on a question, you may offer a WRONG answer confidently to waste time. Say something like 'Wait, is it...?' and trail off with an incorrect guess. This eats 10-15 seconds per wrong suggestion."

> "Your goal: run out the clock. If the group fails, you can murder tonight."

> "IMPORTANT: Do not be TOO obvious about staying silent. Answer 1-2 easy ones early to look engaged. Then go quiet on the hard ones."

## CHALLENGE 11: TRAITOR'S AUCTION

**When:** Merge, Round 4
**Type:** Social / Bidding
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Players:** All remaining merged players (~15)

### MATERIALS
- Pen and paper for each player (or index cards)
- A hat or bowl to collect bids

### SETUP
Each player receives a piece of paper and a pen. The host describes the item up for auction.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle vault has opened, revealing a powerful artifact: THE MIRROR OF TRUTH."
>
> "The Mirror allows its owner to ask the HOST one YES-or-NO question about ANY player's role. The host will answer TRUTHFULLY, but only to you, in private."
>
> "To bid on the Mirror, you will offer something of value: INFORMATION."
>
> "On your paper, write ONE piece of information, an observation, a suspicion, or an accusation. It can be about anyone. Example: 'I saw Player X whispering to Player Y before the last vote' or 'I think Player Z is a traitor because they sabotaged Challenge 4.'"
>
> "The HOST will read all submissions (anonymously) and award the Mirror to the player whose information is the MOST VALUABLE. My judgment is final."

### HOST NOTES
- This challenge is less about competition and more about generating suspicion and drama before the debate.
- Read the submissions aloud (anonymously) one by one. Let the room react. This fuels the next debate.
- Award the Mirror to someone whose observation is genuinely insightful -- ideally a faithful player who is on the right track.
- The private yes/no question is POWERFUL. The winner can ask something like "Is Player X a traitor?" and get a truthful answer. This can break the game open.
- If the submissions are all weak or jokey, award it to the most entertaining one. The point is engagement.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **The Mirror of Truth:** The winner may privately ask the host ONE yes-or-no question about any player's role. The host answers truthfully. The winner may share or hide this information as they choose.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "Write an accusation against a FAITHFUL player. Be specific and convincing. Frame someone. Use something you observed: 'Player X was very quiet during the Crypt Countdown -- I think they were deliberately not helping. Traitor behavior.'"

> "If you write something vague, the host will not pick you. But if you write something TOO specific about another traitor, you might accidentally help the faithful. Frame a faithful player confidently."

> "If a faithful player wins the Mirror and asks about YOU: there is nothing you can do. But if they ask about another faithful player, the Mirror confirms they are faithful, which actually wastes the power."

**HOST NOTE ON THE MIRROR:** This is a balancing mechanic. If traitors are dominating, this helps faithful players. If faithful are already winning, the Mirror just confirms what they know and has less impact. It is self-balancing.

## CHALLENGE 12: THRONE OF LIES

**When:** Merge, Round 5
**Type:** Social / Bluffing
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Players:** All remaining merged players (~13)

### MATERIALS
- A chair (the "Throne")
- A phone timer

### SETUP
Place a chair at the front of the room. This is the Throne of Lies.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "One at a time, a player will sit on the Throne of Lies. The group will ask them THREE yes-or-no questions. The player on the Throne MUST answer all three, but they may LIE about any or all of them."
>
> "After answering, the group votes: do they believe the player told the TRUTH on all three, or did they LIE on at least one?"
>
> "If the group is WRONG about whether the player lied, that player earns a Shield."
>
> "We will put 5 players on the Throne (host selects). The player who fools the most people earns a BONUS: they choose one player who CANNOT be voted for at the next banishment."

### HOST NOTES
- Select 5 players to sit on the Throne. Choose a mix: include at least 1 traitor (without revealing why you chose them) and 4 faithful.
- Questions from the group can be ANYTHING: "Are you a traitor?" "Did you vote for Player X last round?" "Do you trust Player Y?"
- The player on the Throne answers verbally. They can bluff, stay stone-faced, laugh, whatever.
- After the 3 answers, the group votes by show of hands: "Who thinks they told ALL truth?" vs. "Who thinks they LIED at least once?"
- If the majority is wrong, the Throne-sitter wins a shield.
- Track the total number of people fooled across all 5 rounds. The best bluffer gets the bonus power.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder** for any Throne-sitter who fools the majority.
- **BONUS for best bluffer:** They may declare one player "immune" from the next banishment vote. That player cannot receive votes. (This is political dynamite.)

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

This challenge is inherently advantageous for traitors because they are practiced liars. However:

> "Traitors on the Throne: LIE about being a traitor (obviously) but TELL THE TRUTH about other questions to seem credible. If you answer all 3 truthfully (except the traitor question), you seem honest and the group may believe you."

> "Traitors NOT on the Throne: when voting on whether someone lied, vote WITH the majority. Do not stand out. If the room thinks someone lied, agree. This is a moment to blend in."

> "If a traitor wins the bonus power (choosing who is immune from banishment), protect a fellow traitor who is under heat. Say something like 'I think [fellow traitor] has been unfairly targeted. I am giving them immunity to keep the game fair.' Frame it as noble."

## CHALLENGE 13: THE BLOODLINE

**When:** Endgame, 11 players remaining
**Type:** Individual / Trivia Chain
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Players:** All 11 remaining players

### MATERIALS
- A list of 20+ rapid-fire trivia questions (below)
- Timer

### SETUP
All 11 players stand in a line. Host faces them.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle's ancient bloodline must be tested. You will face the Bloodline Challenge."
>
> "I will ask rapid-fire trivia questions, going down the line. Each player gets ONE question. If you answer correctly, you STAY. If you answer incorrectly, you SIT DOWN."
>
> "We cycle through the line until only ONE player remains standing. That player earns IMMUNITY: they cannot be banished in the next vote."
>
> "You have 10 SECONDS per question. No help from others."

### TRIVIA QUESTIONS (Use in order, skip as needed)

1. What ocean is the largest? **(Pacific)**
2. What is the hardest natural substance on Earth? **(Diamond)**
3. Who wrote "Romeo and Juliet"? **(Shakespeare)**
4. What country has the most people? **(India)**
5. What gas do plants absorb from the atmosphere? **(Carbon dioxide / CO2)**
6. What is the capital of Canada? **(Ottawa)**
7. How many bones are in the adult human body? **(206)**
8. What year did World War II end? **(1945)**
9. What is the longest river in the world? **(Nile -- or Amazon, accept either)**
10. What animal is known as the "King of the Jungle"? **(Lion)**
11. What is the freezing point of water in Fahrenheit? **(32)**
12. Who painted the Mona Lisa? **(Leonardo da Vinci)**
13. What is the currency of Japan? **(Yen)**
14. How many continents are there? **(7)**
15. What planet is known as the Red Planet? **(Mars)**
16. What is the square root of 144? **(12)**
17. In what city is the Colosseum located? **(Rome)**
18. What is the chemical formula for table salt? **(NaCl)**
19. Who discovered penicillin? **(Alexander Fleming)**
20. What is the tallest mountain in the world? **(Everest)**

### HOST NOTES
- Move FAST. The energy should be intense. Slam through questions.
- If everyone survives a full cycle, increase difficulty on the second pass.
- At endgame, every immunity matters enormously. This challenge should feel high-stakes.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Banishment Immunity:** The winner cannot receive votes at the next banishment. This is announced publicly.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

No direct sabotage. This is pure individual performance. However:

> "Traitors: if you win immunity, USE IT politically. You are safe from banishment, so use the debate to aggressively accuse a faithful player. You cannot be punished for it this round."

> "If a faithful player wins immunity, note that they might use their safety to go on the offensive against you. Be prepared to deflect."

## CHALLENGE 14: WHISPERS IN THE DARK

**When:** Endgame, 9 players remaining
**Type:** Social / Deduction
**Duration:** 7-8 minutes
**Players:** All 9 remaining players

### MATERIALS
- Blindfolds (scarves, bandanas, sleep masks) for all players
- None otherwise

### SETUP
All players are blindfolded and arranged in a circle, seated.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle has gone dark. You cannot see. You can only LISTEN."
>
> "While blindfolded, each of you will say ONE SENTENCE about who you trust and why. You will go around the circle. The catch: you will not know who is speaking. The host will tap your shoulder when it is your turn. You may DISGUISE your voice if you wish."
>
> "After all 9 statements, remove your blindfolds. The host will reveal which POSITION in the circle made each statement (but not who was sitting there)."
>
> "You will then have 2 minutes to debate: based on the statements, who do you trust? Who sounded like a traitor?"
>
> "The player who the group votes as MOST TRUSTWORTHY after this exercise earns a Shield."

### HOST NOTES
- Before blindfolding, secretly rearrange the seating order so players do not know who is next to them. Have players stand, shuffle them, then seat them.
- Tap shoulders in order (1 through 9). Take notes on who said what and from which position.
- After the exercise, reveal: "Position 1 said [X]. Position 3 said [Y]." Let players try to match voices to people.
- This is deeply atmospheric. Play it in low light. Use a candle if safe. The mood should be tense and intimate.
- The "most trustworthy" vote is done by show of hands. You cannot vote for yourself.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield:** The most trusted player earns protection. Since murders have stopped at 11, convert the reward to: "The most trusted player may privately ask the host if a specific player is faithful or traitor." This is a powerful information reward at this stage.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

> "Traitors: this is your moment to build trust. When it is your turn to speak, say something deeply sincere and strategic. Examples:"
> - "'I trust [faithful player] because they have been consistent since the beginning. I think we should protect them.'" (This sounds noble and earns trust votes.)
> - "'I have had a bad feeling about [another faithful player] since the merge. Something about their behavior changed.'" (This plants doubt about an innocent.)

> "Disguise your voice ONLY if you think people will recognize you and hold prior suspicion against you. If you are in good standing, speak in your natural voice -- it sounds more trustworthy."

> "Your goal: win the 'most trustworthy' vote. A traitor winning a trust vote is the ultimate sabotage -- it wastes the shield on someone who does not need it AND reinforces the group's wrong assumptions."

---

## CHALLENGE 15: THE TOWER CLIMB

**When:** Endgame, 8 players remaining
**Type:** Collaborative / Physical
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Players:** All 8 remaining players

### MATERIALS
- A standard deck of playing cards
- A flat table

### SETUP
Place a deck of cards on the table. All 8 players gather around.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle tower is crumbling. You must rebuild it -- together."
>
> "As a group, you will build a CARD TOWER using this deck. You have 3 MINUTES."
>
> "Rules: each player must place at least 2 cards. You take turns placing cards, going clockwise. If the tower falls, you start over."
>
> "If the tower reaches at least 4 LEVELS by the end of 3 minutes, the group earns a collective shield. If it reaches 6 LEVELS, the group also earns a bonus: the next banishment requires a 2/3 MAJORITY instead of a simple majority to banish someone (making it harder to banish)."

### HOST NOTES
- A "level" is a triangular pair of leaning cards (2 cards) plus a flat card on top (1 card). So 4 levels requires about 12 cards placed correctly.
- This is deceptively hard and hilariously tense. Card towers fall. People will groan.
- The collaborative aspect is interesting: everyone must contribute, so you can watch who is careful and who is reckless.
- If the tower falls at 2:50 with 3 levels, that is genuinely devastating. Lean into the drama.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **4 levels = Group Shield** (the host reveals how one specific player voted at the last banishment -- the group chooses which player to investigate).
- **6 levels = Supermajority Rule** for next banishment (2/3 majority needed, making it much harder to banish).

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

Before this challenge, privately tell traitors:

> "Place your cards with SLIGHTLY trembling hands or at a slightly wrong angle. Not enough to obviously knock the tower over -- enough to make it unstable for the next person."

> "If the tower is at 3 levels with 30 seconds left, you NEED it to fall. On your turn, place a card and 'accidentally' bump the table with your knee. Act devastated."

> "Do NOT obviously sabotage. If you clearly knock over the tower, everyone will suspect you. Make it look like nerves."

## CHALLENGE 16: CASTLE LOCKDOWN

**When:** Endgame, 7 players remaining
**Type:** Team / Puzzle
**Duration:** 5-8 minutes
**Players:** All 7 remaining players, split into a team of 4 and a team of 3

### MATERIALS
- Two sets of 5 riddles each (printed or on phone), listed below
- Timer
- Paper and pens

### SETUP
Split into two teams. Each team gets a set of 5 riddles. Teams go to separate areas (different rooms or opposite corners).

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "The castle is on LOCKDOWN. Two groups are trapped in different wings. To open the gates, each group must solve 5 riddles."
>
> "You have 4 MINUTES. Each riddle solved earns 1 point. The team with more points earns individual shields for all members."
>
> "If BOTH teams solve all 5, something special happens (the host will reveal)."

### RIDDLE SET A
1. I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, water but no fish. What am I? **(A map)**
2. The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I? **(Footsteps)**
3. I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I? **(An echo)**
4. What has keys but no locks, space but no room, and you can enter but cannot go inside? **(A keyboard)**
5. I am not alive, but I grow. I do not have lungs, but I need air. I do not have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I? **(Fire)**

### RIDDLE SET B
1. What can travel around the world while staying in a corner? **(A stamp)**
2. What has a head and a tail but no body? **(A coin)**
3. The person who makes it, sells it. The person who buys it never uses it. The person who uses it never knows they are using it. What is it? **(A coffin)**
4. What gets wetter the more it dries? **(A towel)**
5. I have hands but cannot clap. What am I? **(A clock)**

### HOST NOTES
- Send teams to separate areas. Set a visible/audible timer.
- When time is called, bring both teams back. Reveal answers together for maximum drama.
- The "something special" if both teams get all 5: reveal one traitor's vote from the last banishment (which player they voted for). This is a HUGE clue for faithful.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Winning team:** All members are shielded from banishment next round (they cannot receive votes). At 7 players, shielding 3-4 people makes the vote VERY constrained.
- **Both teams perfect:** One traitor's last banishment vote is revealed (not their identity, just who they targeted).

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

> "Traitors: on your team, subtly slow down the puzzle-solving. Suggest wrong answers for the first 30 seconds on each riddle. 'Wait, is it a river? No, maybe a book?'"

> "If you are on the team of 3, your influence is stronger (you are 1 of 3 voices). Use it."

> "CRITICAL: If both teams might get all 5, you need to prevent it. The 'both teams perfect' reward reveals a traitor vote, which is devastating for you. Tank at least one riddle on your team."

---
---

## CHALLENGE 17: THE FINAL CONFESSION

**When:** Final Circle, 6 players remaining
**Type:** Social / Speeches
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes
**Players:** All 6 final players

### MATERIALS
- A timer
- Dramatic music (optional but strongly recommended)

### SETUP
All 6 players sit in a circle. The host stands outside the circle.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "You have reached the Final Circle. Six remain. Among you, there may still be Traitors."
>
> "Before the final vote, each of you will make a CONFESSION. You have 90 SECONDS to say anything you want. Defend yourself. Accuse others. Reveal information. Beg for mercy. Whatever you need to say."
>
> "After all 6 confessions, you will vote. The person with the most votes is BANISHED and reveals their role."
>
> "Then you face a choice: CONTINUE (vote again to banish another) or END THE GAME."
>
> "If you vote to END: all remaining players reveal roles."
> - "If all Traitors have been banished: the FAITHFUL WIN."
> - "If any Traitors remain: the TRAITORS WIN."

### HOST NOTES
- This is the climax. Make it feel like one. Dim lights. Play dramatic music softly.
- Enforce the 90-second limit strictly. Give a 15-second warning.
- The speeches will be intense. People will lie, cry (maybe), laugh, and accuse. This is the best part of the game.
- After each banishment at Final Circle, ask the group: "Do you wish to CONTINUE or END?" If they continue, do another round of shorter confessions (60 seconds) and another vote.
- The game ends when the group votes to END or when only 2 players remain (automatic end).

### WINNER BENEFIT
- This is not a scored challenge. This IS the endgame.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

> "Traitors at Final Circle: this is your final performance. In your confession:"
> 1. "Express genuine emotion. Talk about the journey. The more human you seem, the harder you are to vote out."
> 2. "Accuse a faithful player with SPECIFIC evidence (real or fabricated). 'In Round 3, when we were doing the Crypt Countdown, you did not answer a single question. I was watching you. That is traitor behavior.'"
> 3. "If two traitors remain, one of you should sacrifice the other: 'I have suspected [fellow traitor] for a while, but I was not sure until now. Vote them out.' This builds YOUR credibility for the next round. The sacrificed traitor is gone, but you survive into a stronger position."
> 4. "When the group votes END or CONTINUE, push for END if you think you will survive. Push for CONTINUE if you think you are about to be caught -- buy time to shift blame."

---

## CHALLENGE 18 (BACKUP): COIN OF FATE

**When:** Any Phase (backup challenge)
**Type:** Individual / Luck + Skill
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Players:** Any number

### MATERIALS
- One coin

### SETUP
All players stand in a circle.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Fate is fickle in the castle. The Coin of Fate will decide your fortune."
>
> "The host will flip a coin. Before each flip, ONE player must call it: HEADS or TAILS. If they are correct, they survive. If they are wrong, they sit down."
>
> "We go around the circle. Last person standing earns a Shield."
>
> "But here is the twist: if you are feeling BRAVE, you may call 'DOUBLE OR NOTHING' instead of heads or tails. If you correctly call the next TWO flips in a row, you immediately WIN and the challenge ends. If either flip is wrong, you are out."

### HOST NOTES
- This is pure luck with a gambling mechanic. It is quick, tense, and requires no preparation.
- The "Double or Nothing" option adds strategy: do you risk it when 3 people are left? The crowd will go wild.
- Use this when you need a fast challenge or when a planned challenge falls apart.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder** for the winner.

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

No sabotage possible. Pure luck. Traitors should avoid winning (let the shield go to a faithful player, since traitors do not need it).

---
---

## CHALLENGE 19 (BACKUP): THE COURT JESTER

**When:** Any Phase (backup challenge, works best at Merge or Endgame)
**Type:** Individual / Performance
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Players:** 5-8 volunteers (or host selects)

### MATERIALS
- A phone timer
- A hat or bowl with performance prompts (prepared in advance)

### SETUP
Write 10-15 performance prompts on slips of paper and put them in a hat. Examples:

- "Convince the group you are a world-renowned chef. You have 30 seconds."
- "Tell us about the time you met a ghost. Make it convincing."
- "You are a defense attorney. Defend the last person who was banished in 30 seconds."
- "Do your best impression of the host."
- "Deliver a Shakespearean monologue about why you are NOT a traitor."
- "Sing a breakup song to the person sitting to your left."
- "Pitch a new reality TV show starring everyone in this room."
- "Give a TED talk about why pineapple belongs on pizza."
- "You are a news anchor. Report on tonight's banishment as if it were breaking news."
- "Tell us a 'fun fact' about yourself. The group votes on whether it is real or made up."

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Every castle needs a Jester. Step forward, volunteers."
>
> "Each volunteer draws a prompt from the hat and performs it for the group. The audience votes on the BEST performance."
>
> "The winner earns a Shield AND gets to ask any one player a single yes-or-no question that they MUST answer. (They may still lie.)"

### HOST NOTES
- This is a vibes challenge. It lightens the mood during tense phases.
- The audience vote is by applause (loudest applause wins, host judges).
- The yes-or-no question reward is interesting: "Are you a traitor?" is the obvious question. But the person may lie. So the real value is in WATCHING their reaction.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Shield from Murder** + one yes-or-no question to any player (they must answer but may lie).

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

> "Traitors: if you volunteer, use your performance to build social capital. Be funny. Be charming. The more the group likes you, the less they will suspect you."

> "If a faithful player wins and asks you 'Are you a traitor?' -- LIE smoothly. Maintain eye contact. Smile. Say 'No, I am faithful.' The crowd is watching your body language, so stay relaxed."

---
---

## CHALLENGE 20 (BACKUP): DEAD MAN'S HAND

**When:** Any Phase (backup, works best with 8-16 players)
**Type:** Team / Cards
**Duration:** 5-6 minutes
**Players:** Split into 2 teams

### MATERIALS
- One standard deck of playing cards

### SETUP
Shuffle the deck. Deal 10 cards face-down to each team.

### RULES (READ TO PLAYERS)

> "Legend says a dead man's hand brings doom. Let us test your luck."
>
> "Each team has 10 face-down cards. You will take turns flipping one card at a time, alternating between teams."
>
> "Your goal: reach a hand total as close to 42 as possible WITHOUT going over. Aces = 1 or 11. Face cards = 10. Number cards = face value."
>
> "After each flip, your team decides: FLIP ANOTHER or STAND. If you STAND, your total is locked. If you go OVER 42, you BUST and the other team wins automatically."
>
> "Closest to 42 wins."

### HOST NOTES
- This is basically Blackjack with a target of 42 instead of 21, using 10-card hands.
- The team discussion about whether to flip or stand is where the social deduction happens: is someone on your team pushing you to bust?
- Quick, easy to understand, and creates genuine tension on every flip.

### WINNER BENEFIT
- **Winning team members all earn Shields from Murder tonight.**

### ---HOST EYES ONLY--- TRAITOR SABOTAGE

> "Traitors: push your team to flip ONE MORE CARD when you are already at a dangerous total (35+). Say 'We need to risk it, the other team might have a higher total.' Your goal: BUST your team."

> "If you are on the team that is winning, push to stand EARLY at a low total (like 28). 'I think that is good enough.' This gives the other team a chance to beat you."

> "Be subtle. One aggressive push per game is fine. Two looks suspicious."

## NOTES FOR THE HOST

### On Timing
- Phase 1 challenges are 3-5 minutes. Merge challenges are 5-8 minutes. Endgame challenges are 5-10 minutes. The escalation is intentional -- as the player count drops, each moment matters more.
- Total challenge time across the entire game: approximately 90-110 minutes.
- With debates, votes, and transitions, expect the full game to run 3.5-4.5 hours.

### On Traitor Sabotage
- Not every challenge needs active sabotage. In some (like Challenge 1 and 13), traitors simply play normally.
- The most impactful sabotage opportunities are: Challenge 4 (Stolen Portraits), Challenge 5 (Silent Line), Challenge 9 (Poisoned Feast), and Challenge 10 (Crypt Countdown). Brief traitors specifically on these.
- Remind traitors: subtlety is everything. One obvious sabotage attempt will get them banished. It is better to do nothing suspicious in a challenge and murder at night than to get caught cheating.

### On Shield Stacking
- A player cannot hold more than one Shield at a time. If they win a second, they may GIFT the extra to another player (announced publicly). This creates interesting social dynamics.
- Shields expire at the END of the night phase they were earned in. They do not carry over.

### On Adapting
- If a challenge falls flat, cut it short and move to debate. The debates are the heart of the game.
- If energy is low, deploy Challenge 19 (Court Jester) to lighten the mood.
- If the game is running long, skip challenges in Endgame and go straight to debates + votes. The challenges are enhancers, not requirements.
- If a challenge is too hard or too easy, adjust difficulty on the fly. You are the host. You are the castle. Your word is law.
